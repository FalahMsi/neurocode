## 📘 About the Project

**NeuroCode** is a cognitively inspired framework for understanding source code.  
It simulates a **neural memory system** for machines by extracting lightweight "code neurons" from source code, documentation, and usage patterns.

These code neurons are:

- **Activated only when relevant**
- **Forgotten when unused** (simulating memory decay)
- **Context-weighted** based on frequency and recency
- **Organized** to mimic human cognitive behavior (contextual recall, associative memory, long-term consolidation)

🎯 The ultimate goal:  
To **reduce reliance on constant full LLM inference** by emulating **selective memory recall** — the way the human brain activates specific memory pathways depending on the task.

## 🧩 Why Pluggable Knowledge Matters

In many domains, it's impractical or impossible to pretrain on proprietary or evolving data (e.g., private source code, stories in progress, custom ontologies).  
**NeuroCode** offers a new model: treating knowledge as **modular and pluggable**.

- You can inject dynamic code or domain-specific memory on the fly.
- The system decides which neurons to activate, ignore, or decay — just like adaptive cognitive memory.
- This makes NeuroCode useful for real-time, domain-specific, or privacy-critical environments.

🙋 Looking for Adoption

This is a public, open-source intellectual initiative.
Due to personal resource constraints, I cannot continue development alone.
