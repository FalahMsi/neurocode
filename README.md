# NeuroCode ‚Äì Modular Cognitive AI for Code Understanding

**An open intellectual initiative to reimagine how machines understand code ‚Äî inspired by the human brain.**

---

## üß† About the Project

NeuroCode proposes a cognitively inspired framework for understanding source code.  
It simulates a **neural memory system** for AI by extracting lightweight ‚Äúcode neurons‚Äù from source code, documentation, and code usage patterns.

These code neurons are:

- **Activated only when relevant**
- **Forgotten when unused**
- **Context-weighted based on frequency and proximity**
- **Organized to mimic human cognitive structures** (contextual recall, associative memory, long-term consolidation)

The ultimate goal:  
To **reduce dependence on massive inference from LLMs** by emulating **selective memory recall** ‚Äî just like the brain activates only specific pathways based on task or context.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Assuming Python environment is ready
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (if requirements file is added later)
python main.py
```

## üëê Open Initiative Statement

> This project is part of an **open, rights-free intellectual initiative**.  
> It is **not licensed for commercial restriction or control**.  
> The purpose is to inspire research and development in the field of cognitive AI.

The author **does not claim ownership or intellectual property**.  
Anyone interested ‚Äî individuals, researchers, or companies ‚Äî are welcome to build, expand, and evolve the idea.

I am **not a company nor a funder**, and due to resource limitations, I was unable to bring this vision to life.  
But I strongly believe in its potential, and hope others will take it further.

## üß¨ Why We Need Medical Experts Too

Cognitive AI ‚Äî if truly modeled after the brain ‚Äî **must involve the medical and neuroscience fields**.

The development of NeuroCode (and similar technologies) **should include a specialized medical team** across:

- Neurology
- Cognitive science
- Behavioral psychology
- Brain imaging and interpretation

The collaboration between **technologists and medical professionals** is crucial to creating stronger, biologically inspired AI.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Possibilities (for anyone interested in expanding the project)

- Interactive visual memory simulator
- Plugin-based support for multiple languages (JavaScript, Rust, etc.)
- GPT-based suggestion engine to simulate associative recall
- Fine-tuned models with memory-attention optimization

## üè∑Ô∏è Topics

`ai`, `llm`, `cognitive-ai`, `neurosymbolic`, `python`, `code-analysis`
