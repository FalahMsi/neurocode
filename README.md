## 📘 About the Project

NeuroCode proposes a cognitively inspired framework for understanding source code.  
It simulates a **neural memory system** for AI by extracting lightweight “code neurons” from source code, documentation, and code usage patterns.

These code neurons are:

- **Activated only when relevant**
- **Forgotten when unused**
- **Context-weighted based on frequency and proximity**
- **Organized to mimic human cognitive structures** (contextual recall, associative memory, long-term consolidation)

🎯 The ultimate goal:  
To **reduce dependence on massive inference from LLMs** by emulating **selective memory recall** — just like the brain activates only specific pathways based on task or context.
