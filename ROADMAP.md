# ðŸ§­ Project Roadmap â€“ NeuroCode

A structured plan for how the NeuroCode initiative will grow, evolve, and attract collaboration.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

To simulate human-like neural memory for code understanding, using lightweight code neurons that are selectively activated, forgotten, or strengthened based on context â€” reducing reliance on large-scale LLM inference.

---

## ðŸ§  Phase 1 â€“ Conceptual Foundation (âœ… Completed)
- âœ… Designed initial architecture simulating human memory using "code neurons"
- âœ… Removed heavy files and cleaned repository
- âœ… Uploaded project to GitHub with proper `.gitignore` and description
- âœ… Published the open initiative as `initiative.pdf`

---

## ðŸ”¬ Phase 2 â€“ Research & Interdisciplinary Collaboration
- [ ] Reach out to neuroscience and cognitive experts for medical collaboration
- [ ] Invite AI engineers, code analysts, and researchers to participate
- [ ] Share the open initiative with academic communities and forums

---

## ðŸ§ª Phase 3 â€“ Prototype Implementation
- [ ] Build a minimal proof-of-concept showing how "neurons" activate/deactivate
- [ ] Simulate associative memory and contextual recall in small code examples
- [ ] Benchmark against traditional LLM usage in code tasks

---

## ðŸ”„ Phase 4 â€“ Institutional Outreach
- [ ] Present the initiative to leading companies (OpenAI, DeepMind, etc.)
- [ ] Explore partnerships for research funding or joint ventures

---

## ðŸ“¦ Phase 5 â€“ Public Alpha
- [ ] Release a simplified interactive Alpha version
- [ ] Launch a community contribution model with modular extensions
